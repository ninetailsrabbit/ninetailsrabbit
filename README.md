## Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm N9 (ninetailsrabbit)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my multiplayer FPS game `Linen`
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning game development in general but more focused on programming
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects about Godot or tools for devs
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not a Rabbit!

I've founded the organization named [IndiePipeline](https://github.com/Indie-Pipeline) dedicated to creating resources and plugins that streamline video game development with Godot. I'm open to exploring opportunities with other engines in the future.
